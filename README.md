# Maze Game

A small maze game used to show the basic usage of the SDL2 library in C.


## Dependencies

- SDL2
- SDL2_image
- [TMX](https://github.com/baylej/tmx)
- [libXML2](http://www.xmlsoft.org/)

The program depends on SDL2 and SDL2_image, as well as a C parser for TMX
files. TMX is a XML-format used by the [Tiled map
editor](http://www.mapeditor.org/), a free and open-source software used to
create maps. In particular, the TMX parser uses LibXML2.

## Supported platforms

Tested on Mac OS 10.10.5 (Yosemite). In principle, it should work on any UNIX
system provided that the dependencies are all installed.

## Compilation

Make sure you have installed all dependencies. The compilation relies on the
`sdl2-config` program that is shipped when installing `libsdl2-dev`, and the
`xml2-config` program shipped with `libxml2-dev`. You also need to install a
TMX parser for C.

Move to the `src` folder and then simply type

~~~
make
~~~

followed by

~~~
./maze
~~~

to run.

## Content

There are two folders:

1. `assets` contain all assets used in the game. This includes
    1. A TMX file (`level1.tmx`) storing the single maze in this game;
    1. Three text images (`play.png`, `quit.png` and `maze.png`) used in the
       menu;
    1. Two Blender files (`assets.blend` and `character.blend`) used to render
       the spritesheets;
    1. A texture used by Blender for the character (`character-texture.png`);
    1. The tiles generated by Blender (`maze-tile*.png`);
    1. An animable sprite sheet (`character/walking.png`) for animating the
       character.
1. `src` contain all header and source files (`*.h`, `*.c`).

## Status

There is currently no known bug.
